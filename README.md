# Students-Records-Python
In my 3rd  year at university, I made a system using Python language has a profile for admin and students to manage the records with different a features for each.the system has a file for each student with an information about the courses he took in each semester, the hours for it,  and its grade. It allows admins to add a new record for a student, a semester with courses and grades, update any data, search for students, depending on the taken horse or average grades, or even get a chart that shows the student or global statistics.
The Courses file, has each course's id, with its hours.
And there's a file with the student's ID that has each course he took in each semester with its grade.
